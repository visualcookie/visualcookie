# Hej 👋

Cool that you found my profile. Name's Dean and I'm a passionate developer (not just doing frontend), who also likes beautiful user interfaces and a convenient user experience. Apart from developing a bunch of private side projects (which mostly won't ever see the light), I like gaming 🎮 and going out to concerts 🎸. For a couple of years now, I'm trying to care a lot for my environment, hence why I started going vegan 🌱 whenever I can.

Right now I work as an Allround-Developer (🔥) at [sipgate](https://sipgate.de) a very cool telecommunication company based in Düsseldorf. Previously I've worked at Fintory, building React-Apps and tiny backends for the finance world. I've always had a huge passion for various types of programming languages, hence why I'll always ❤️ keeping an eye out for things, I've never seen before and try them out firsthand.

## Things I want to learn/improve

- Korean 🇰🇷
- AI stuff
- Creating 3D Models (Blender)
- Unity
- Better understanding of backends
- CyberSec
- Becoming more open to new concepts

*There's a lot more I could add to this list, but the above once are the most valuable once to me.*
